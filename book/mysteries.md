## Overview

I often hit snags that seem to defy logic and Google.  I'll put them here for now and maybe someone can weigh in on the solutions.

## settings.local.php causes WSOD

Updated: 8-30-23

In this case, I loaded a site onto my new m2 mac from git, fired up ddev, imported a current production database, confirmed the site was running and logged into it.  Then I added the stock `sites/default/settings.local/php` as well as `sites/development.services.yml`. Anything I do caused this kind of error.  No amount of cache clearing, config importing etc. will make it work/

```
The website encountered an unexpected error. Please try again later.
