Config is stored in yml files so it can be checked into git. It is
loaded into the config table of the database for performance. Use  `drush config-import` (or `drush cim`) for this purpose. Config includes database table definitions, views definitions and lots more.  You can even use config to store a little setting indicating your site is in a `test` mode which can trigger displaying some useful information that only you can see.

Config files should be stored in a non-web accessible directory and
specified in settings.php e.g.

```php
$settings['config_sync_directory'] = '../config/sync';
```

## Load some config

This example shows how to load a rest endpoint from config. This is very similar to Drupal 7 `variable_get()`.

Use the Configuration API main entry point `\Drupal::config()` to load the config item and then use `get()` to retrieve the value you want. Config can have multiple values in a single yml file.

```php
$pizzaEndpoint = \Drupal::config('pizza_academy_core.pbx.rest.endpoint');
$pizza_service_url = $pizzaEndpoint->get('pizza_rest_endpoint').$reg_id;
```

When you export the config, this information is stored in a file called `pizza_academy_core.pbx.rest.endpoint.yml` with a key `pizza_rest_endpoint`.

The contents of the file are simply:

```
pizza_rest_endpoint: 'https://pbx.pizza.com/pbx-profile-service/'
```

You'll find this in a file in the config sync directory specified in
`settings.php` e.g.

```
config/sync/pizza_academy_core.pbx.rest.endpoint.yml
```

The config sync directory location is specified in `settings.php` like
this

```php
$settings['config_sync_directory'] = '../config/sync';
```

[More on creating custom modules: Using your own configuration](https://www.drupal.org/docs/creating-custom-modules/defining-and-using-your-own-configuration-in-drupal)

[Drupal::config API Reference](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal.php/function/Drupal%3A%3Aconfig/9.2.x)

You can override config items in a `settings.php` or `local.settings.php` using the `$config` global variable. 

## Views

For views, the config filenames are be in the form `views.view.infofeeds` for a view called `infofeeds`.

## Add config to an existing module

You simply create a yml file in the module's `/config/install` directory.

The config file should start with the module name then a period and the thing you want to store the config about. So `modulename.something.yml` e.g.
`dir_salesforce.cron.yml` for cron information, `dir.funnelback.yml` for funnelback information or
`tea_teks_spr.testing.yml` for testing information.

If the module name is pizza_academy_core and the thing I want to store
config about is the pbxpath, I would create a file called
`pizza_academy_core.pbxpath.yml`.

The yml filename is passed as a parameter into
`\Drupal::config('...')` without the `.yml` extension. e.g. if the
filename is `danamod.header_footer_settings.yml` then use:

```php
$config = \Drupal::config('danamod.header_footer_settings');
```

Here we add some configuration to a module called pizza_academy_core:

In docroot/modules/custom/pizza_academy_core/config/install/pizza_academy_core.pbxpath.yml

We have a file with the contents:

```yml
url: 'https://pbx.pizza.com/'
langcode: 'en'
```

You can copy it to the `config/sync` directory, manually paste the contents into the config Drupal u/i or import it into the db with drush.  The drush way is the easiest in my opinion.

```
drush config-import --source=modules/custom/pizza_academy_core/config/install/ --partial -y
```

Then you can access it from a controller at `docroot/modules/custom/pizza_academy_core/src/Controller/VerifyCertificationPage.php` using the following code:

```php
$pbx_path_config = \Drupal::config('pizza_academy_core.pbxpath');
$pbx_path = $pbx_path_config->get('url');
$pbx_achievements_url = $pbx_path . "achievements?regid=".$reg_id;
```

Once you grab the url, you can use it later in your code.

## Import something you changed in your module

During module development, you might find you want to add some configuration.  This is very useful as part of that workflow.

```
drush @dev2 config-import --source=modules/migrate/test1/config/install/ --partial -y
```

Note. the @dev2 is a site alias.  See [Drush alias docs for more info](https://www.drush.org/latest/site-aliases/). These are sooo useful.

## Config Storage in the database

Config is also kept in the config table of the database.

The name field stores the config id e.g. views.view.infofeeds (the definition of a view called infofeeds)

The data field stores the stuff in the config serialized into a blob

## Add some config to site config form

Here we add a phone number to the site config. This is put in a `.module` file.

```php
use Drupal\Core\Form\FormStateInterface;
/**
 * Implements hook_form_FORM_ID_alter().
 */
function mymodule_form_system_site_information_settings_alter(&$form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {

  $form['site_phone'] = [
    '#type' => 'tel',
    '#title' => t('Site phone'),
    '#default_value' =>
      Drupal::config('system.site')->get('phone'),
  ];

  $form['#submit'][] = 'mymodule_system_site_information_phone_submit';
}
```

The `$form['#submit']` modification adds our callback to the form\'s
submit handlers. This allows our module to interact with the form once
it has been submitted. The `mymodule_system_site_information_phone_submit`
callback is passed the form array and form state. We load the current
configuration factory to receive the configuration that can be edited.
We then `load system.site` and save phone based on the value from the form
state.

```php
function mymodule_system_site_information_phone_submit(array &$form,  FormStateInterface $form_state) {
  $config = Drupal::configFactory()->getEditable('system.site');
  $config->set('phone', $form_state->getValue('site_phone'))
    ->save();
}
```

Don't forget there is a [module called config pages](https://www.drupal.org/project/config_pages) which might save you some coding if you need to add some config to a site.

## Override config in settings.php

This can be useful for local development environment (where you might
put these changes into settings.local.php) or on each one of your servers where you might
need some configuration to be slightly different. e.g. dev/test/prod.

Drupal 9 allows global `$config` overrides (similar to drupal 7) The
configuration system integrates these override values via the
`Drupal\Core\Config\ConfigFactory::get()` implementation. When you
retrieve a value from configuration, the global \$config variable gets a
chance to change the returned value:

```php
// Get system site maintenance message text. This value may be overriden by
// default from global $config (as well as translations).
$message = \Drupal::config('system.maintenance')->get('message');
```
To override configuration values in global `$config` in settings.php, use
a line like this (which references the configuration keys:

```php
$config['system.maintenance']['message'] = 'Sorry, our site is down now.';
```

For nested values, use nested array keys

```php
$config['system.performance']['css']['preprocess'] = 0;
```
If you have a configuration change, for example, you have enabled google
tag manager. When you export the config `drush cex -y` and `git diff` to see what changed in config,
you'll see (in the last 2 lines) that status is changed from true to false.

```diff
$ git diff

diff --git a/config/sync/google_tag.container.default.yml b/config/sync/google_tag.container.default.yml
index 39e498c99..375bfb8af 100644
--- a/config/sync/google_tag.container.default.yml
+++ b/config/sync/google_tag.container.default.yml
@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@
 uuid: 5919bbb9-95e3-4d8b-88c8-030e6a58ec6c
 langcode: en
-status: false
+status: true
```

To put this in `settings.php` or `settings.local.php`, add a line and set the value to true or false:

```php
$config['google_tag.container.default']['status'] = false;
```

## Setup a testing variable in config for a project

First create the yml file in your `module/config/install` e.g.
`tea_teks_srp.testing.yml` with this as the contents:

```yml
test_mode: FALSE
```

This will be the default state of the app

In the Drupal U/I under config, devel, configuration synchronization, import, single item i.e. at `/admin/config/development/configuration/single/import` select `simple configuration`. In the configuration name field, put `tea_teks_srp.testing`.

Paste in the text of the file

```yml
test_mode: FALSE
```

and import. This will load the new value into the database.

Then in your `docroot/sites/default/settings.local.php` (to enable testing features) add

```php
$config['tea_teks_srp.testing']['test_mode'] = TRUE;
```

This will override your config you added above so test_mode is true.

Then to use the test_mode, you can load it into a controller class (or form class) from the config (and the value in the `settings.local.php` will override the default) with the following:

```php
$test_mode = \Drupal::config('tea_teks_srp.testing')->get('test_mode');
```

And then just use the `$test_mode` variable as needed e.g.

```php
if ($this->test_mode) {
  $value = $this->t("Reject Citation $citation_nid");
}
```

## Getting and setting configuration with drush

Here we are fiddling with the shield module settings

In config, synchronize, we see an item: `shield.settings`

So we can load it with drush:

```yml
$ drush cget shield.settings
credential_provider: shield
credentials:
  shield:
    user: nistor
    pass: blahblah
print: 'Please provide credentials for access.'
allow_cli: true
_core:
  default_config_hash: c1dcnGFTXFeMq2-Z8e7H6Qxp6TTJe-ZhSA126E3bQJ4
```

Drilling down deeper, let's say we want to view the credentials section. Notice that drush requires a space instead of a colon:

```yml
$ drush cget shield.settings credentials
'shield.settings:credentials':
  shield:
    user: nisor
    pass: blahblah
```
Now to get down to the user name and password. And we are adding period back in. Huh?

```sh
$ drush cget shield.settings credentials.shield
'shield.settings:credentials.shield':
    user: nisor
    pass: blahblah
```

and finally:

```sh
$ drush cget shield.settings credentials.shield.pass
'shield.settings:credentials.shield.pass': blahblah
```

So if you want to **set** these:

```sh
drush cset shield.settings credentials.shield.pass yomama

Do you want to update credentials.shield.pass key in shield.settings
config? (y/n): y
```

And

```sh
drush cset shield.settings credentials.shield.user fred

Do you want to update credentials.shield.pass key in shield.settings
config? (y/n): y
```

And there is that message

```sh
drush cget shield.settings print
'shield.settings:print': 'Please provide credentials for access.'
```

And so

```sh
drush cset -y shield.settings print "Credentials or I won't let you in"
```

and while we're here, we could always put these into the `$config` object
via `settings.php` (or `settings.local.php` :

```php
$config['shield.settings']['credentials']['shield']['user'] = "nisor";
$config['shield.settings']['credentials']['shield']['pass'] = "blahblah";
```
Similarly, for setting stage_file_proxy origin:

```sh
drush config-set stage_file_proxy.settings
origin https://www.mudslinger.com
```

## Creating a module allowing users to edit/update some config

When you want to add a form to allow the user to update the config,
create a module with a form as you would anywhere else. The form will
need the standard `buildForm()`, `submitForm()` and `getFormId()` methods.

e.g. in `docroot/modules/custom/danamod/src/Form/HeaderFooterForm.php`

In the buildform, you load the config object, then  `get` each value from the object, load them into the form (in `#default_value` array items) so the user can see the current value.

```php
// Load the values from config.
$config = \Drupal::config('danamod.header_footer_settings');

$address1 = $config->get('footer_address1');
$address2 = $config->get('footer_address2');
$address3 = $config->get('footer_address3');
$email = $config->get('footer_email');
$logo_url = $config->get('logo_url'); 

// And put them into the form render array.

$form['footer']['footer_address1'] = [
  '#type' => 'textfield',
  '#title' => $this->t('Address line 1'),
  '#default_value' => $address1,
];
$form['footer']['footer_address2'] = [
  '#type' => 'textfield',
  '#title' => $this->t('Address line 2'),
  '#default_value' => $address2,
];
```

In the `submitForm()` member, you extract the values from the `$form_state`, load an editable config object and `->set()` values and `->save()` them.

```php
$config = \Drupal::configFactory()->getEditable('danamod.header_footer_settings');
$values = $form_state->getValues();
$address1 = $values['footer_address1'];
$address2 = $values['footer_address2'];
$config->set('footer_address1', $address1);
$config->set('footer_address2', $address2);

$config->save();

\Drupal::messenger()->addMessage('Values have been saved.');
```

And a little shorthand

```php
$config 
  ->set('display_stars', $display_stars) 
  ->set('display_summary_summative', $display_summary_summative) 
  ->save();

\Drupal::messenger()->addMessage('Values have been saved.');
```

## Using the Config Pages module

[Config Pages](https://www.drupal.org/project/config_pages) is a really useful module which allows you to quickly create some `config` along with forms to control them.  

Here is a screenshot of 4 `bool` fields defined in the Config Pages user interface.
![Fields defined for a config in Config Pages](assets/images/config_pages_fields.png)

Here is the data entry screen:
![Config pages data entry screen](assets/images/config_pages_entry_screen.png)

Here is the code to load the values from the config.

```php
use Drupal\config_pages\Entity\ConfigPages;

  /**
   * Load custom settings from the ConfigPages custom_settings entity.
   */
  protected function loadCustomSettings(): void {
    $custom_settings_entity = ConfigPages::config('custom_settings');
    $this->logBatchVoteTime = $custom_settings_entity->get('field_log_batch_vote_time')->value;
    $this->logSingleVoteTime = $custom_settings_entity->get('field_log_single_vote_time')->value;
    $this->displaySingleVoteTime = $custom_settings_entity->get('field_display_single_vote_time')->value;
    $this->displayBatchVoteTime = $custom_settings_entity->get('field_display_batch_vote_time')->value;
    if ($this->logBatchVoteTime ||
      $this->logSingleVoteTime ||
      $this->displaySingleVoteTime ||
      $this->displayBatchVoteTime) {
      $this->shouldComputeElapsedTime = TRUE;
    }
  }
```

{:.note }
From their [docs page](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/config-pages/usage-of-configpages)
There are other three ways to load the configuration values:

```php
// This example uses side-loading for simplicity.
$config_pages = \Drupal::service('config_pages.loader');
$entity = $config_pages->load($config_page_machine_name, $optional_context);

// This example uses call to a static method load:
$entity = ConfigPages::config($config_page_machine_name);

// This example uses storage manager to get a config page via storage manager:
$storage = \Drupal::entityTypeManager()->getStorage('config_pages');
$entity = $storage->load($config_page_machine_name);
```
Each of these methods, will return a loaded entity with a given active context.


## Drush config commands

Drush will provide you with all the tools you need to fiddle with config from the command line. Check out the [drush docs](https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/all/)

### View config

Note. when you view the value in config, drush cleverly will **ignore values** overidden in settings.php. More below.

`cget` is short for `config:get`.

From the [drush docs](https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/config_get/)

- `drush config:get system.site` - displays the system.site config.

- `drush config:get system.site page.front` -  displays what Drupal is using for the front page of the site: e.g. 

```sh
$ drush config:get system.site page.front
  'system.site:page.front': /node
```

### Viewing overridden config values

When you view the value in config, drush `cleverly` will **ignore values** overidden in settings.php. 

- drush cget narcs_infoconnect.imagepath basepath

This displays the basepath that is in the Drupal database. If you override the basepath in settings.php, you have to use the special flag to see the overridden value.

```sh
drush cget narcs_infoconnect.imagepath basepath --include-overridden
```

Also drush can execute php for a little more fun approach:

```sh
drush ev "var_dump(\Drupal::configFactory()->getEditable('system.site')->get('name'))"
```

or

```sh
drush ev "print \Drupal::config('narcs_inferconnect.imagepath')->get('basepath');"
```

### Delete from config

cdel is short for config:delete.

- `drush \@dev2 cdel migrate_plus.migration.test1`

- `drush \@dev2 cdel migrate_plus.migration_group.default`


### Check what has changed with config:status

`cst` is short for `config:status`

```sh
 drush cst
 --------------------------------------------- ------------
  Name                                          State
 --------------------------------------------- ------------
  admin_toolbar.settings                        Only in DB
  admin_toolbar_tools.settings                  Only in DB
  automated_cron.settings                       Only in DB
  block.block.bartik_account_menu               Only in DB
  block.block.bartik_branding                   Only in DB
  block.block.bartik_breadcrumbs                Only in DB
  block.block.bartik_content                    Only in DB
  ...
```

`Only in DB` means the config has not yet been exported.  Best practice is to check the config info git for loading onto the production site.
Usually you would use `drush cex` at this point to export the config and add it to git.

After exporting drush will report that everything has been exported and that there are no differences between the database and the sync folder.

```sh
drush cst
 [notice] No differences between DB and sync directory.
```

### Export entire config

`cex` is short for `config:export` This will dump the entire config,  a bunch of yml files into the config sync folder which is specified in `settings.php` (or `settings.local.php`) as

```php
$settings['config_sync_directory'] = '../config/sync';
```

- `drush cex -y` - export entire config.

```sh
$ drush cex -y
 [success] Configuration successfully exported to ../config/sync.
../config/sync
```

### Import config changes

If you change the site name (for example) by mistake and want to restore it , you can re-import the values from the last export.

First check what changed with `drush cst` then use `drush cim -y` to restore the config to it's previous glory. `cim` is short for `config:import`.

Drupal cleverly notices which config items have changed and loads only those changes into the database. 

```sh
$ drush cst
 ------------- -----------
  Name          State
 ------------- -----------
  system.site   Different
```

and

```sh
$ drush cim -y
+------------+-------------+-----------+
| Collection | Config      | Operation |
+------------+-------------+-----------+
|            | system.site | Update    |
+------------+-------------+-----------+

 // Import the listed configuration changes?: yes.

 [notice] Synchronized configuration: update system.site.
 [notice] Finalizing configuration synchronization.
 [success] The configuration was imported successfully.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Config export
Sometimes when you try to export config, it seems to randomly decide to delete a lot of config items although `drush config cst` shows just a few items have changed.  In this circumstance, `drush config cim -y` will try to import those few items.

I've found that the problem is related to this setting in the `settings.local.php` (or `settings.php`)


$settings['config_exclude_modules'] = ['devel', 'stage_file_proxy', 'masquerade'];

For some reason, an edge condition is reached which confuses the configuration engine in Drupal.  Commenting out the above line resolves the issue.

I hope this one saves you countless hours of frustration.  I know it has caused me plenty of frustration!
