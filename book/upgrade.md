# Upgrading and patching Drupal and contrib modules
![views](https://api.visitor.plantree.me/visitor-badge/pv?label=views&color=informational&namespace=d9book&key=upgrade.md)

## Updating Drupal Core

if there is `drupal/core-recommended` in your `composer.json` use:

```sh
$ composer update drupal/core-recommended -W
```

if there is no `drupal/core-recommended` in your `composer.json` use:

```sh
$ composer update drupal/core -W
```

Note `composer update -W` is the same as `composer update --with-dependencies`


## Upgrading Drupal 9 to Drupal 10

Much of this is from [Drupalize.me - March 2023](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/upgrade-drupal-10)

- Install the latest and greatest Drupal 9.x version
- If you are using CKEditor, move to CKEditor 5
  - make sure your CKEditor plugins have CKEditor 5 versions (or remove those that don't)
  - Convert text formats to use CKEditor 5. Text formats must be updated one at a time, but switching the editor to CKEditor 5 will automatically migrate your text format configuration to CKEditor 5.
  - Using the Manage administrative menu, navigate to Configuration > Content authoring > Text formats and editors. In the column labeled Text editor, you can tell which text formats are using CKEditor.
  - For each text format that uses CKEditor, under the Operations column, select Configure. and under Text editor, select CKEditor 5.
  - On the configuration page for the text format, under Text editor, select CKEditor 5. Status messages will appear letting you know what changed.
  - After you have updated all CKEditor text formats to CKEditor 5, on the Text formats administrative page, you should see CKEditor 5 listed next to each text format you updated.
  - Check that CKEditor 5 is working ok and uninstall CKEditor.

- Update all your contributed modules and themes to Drupal 10 compatible versions while you're still on Drupal 9.

- Install [Upgrade Status](https://www.drupal.org/project/upgrade_status) module to give you all the recommendations
- Review the report at `https://tea2.ddev.site/admin/reports/upgrade-status`
  - Follow the recommendations to remove projects in the `remove` section
    - This includes modules like: Color, RDF, and themes like: Bartik, Seven and Stable.
  - Update code in modules under the `scan` section
  - Install updated versions of the modules in the `Collaborate with maintainers` section


- Uninstall and remove the Upgrade Status module before upgrading or else upgrading to D10 will fail. 
- You may have to remove Drush and reinstall after you finish upgrade

::: tip Note
Using the --no-update flag updates the composer.json entries, without attempting to resolve and download any files. This allows us to batch updates to projects and avoid a "chicken-or-egg first"-type of issues with shared dependencies. Alternatively, you can edit the version constraints in composer.json manually.
:::

- Update core
  - Update drupal/core-dev
If you have the drupal/core-dev dependencies installed you'll need to update those with:
```
composer require drupal/core-dev:^10.0 --dev --no-update --update-with-dependencies
```
  - Update drupal/core-* projects: i.e. the drupal/core-recommended, drupal/core-composer-scaffold, and drupal/core-project-message projects

```
composer require drupal/core-recommended:^10.0 drupal/core-composer-scaffold:^10.0 drupal/core-project-message:^10.0 --no-update --update-with-all-dependencies
```

  - Then tell Composer to try and resolve and download all the new code:

```
composer update
```

- clear caches and run database updates
  - `drush cr`
  - `drush updb -y`

## Creating a local patch to a contrib module

See Making a patch at <https://www.drupal.org/node/707484>

In this case, I had the file_entity module installed and wanted to hide
the tab "[files.]{.underline}" The tab item is provided by a task (read
"menu tab") in the
web/modules/contrib/file_entity/file_entity.links.task.yml

```yaml
entity.file.collection:
  route_name: entity.file.collection
  base_route: system.admin_content
  title: 'Files'
  description: 'Manage files for your site.'
```

For my patch, I want to remove this section of the `file_entity.links.task.yml` file.

First get the repo/git version of the module

```sh
$ composer update drupal/file_entity --prefer-source
```

Change the file in the text editor

Run git diff to see the changes:

```sh
$ git diff
```

The output shows:

```diff
diff --git a/file_entity.links.task.yml b/file_entity.links.task.yml
index 3ea93fc..039f7f9 100644

```

Create the patch

```sh
git diff >file_entity_disable_file_menu_tab.patch
```

Add the patch to the patches section of composer.json. Notice below the line starting with \"drupal/file_entity\" is the local file patch:

```json
"patches": {
    "drupal/commerce": {
        "Allow order types to have no carts": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2018-03-16/commerce-direct-checkout-50.patch"
    },
    "drupal/views_load_more": {
        "Template change to keep up with core": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/views-load-more-pager-class-2543714-02.patch" ,
        "Problems with exposed filters": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/views_load_more-problems-with-exposed-filters-2630306-4.patch"
    },
    "drupal/easy_breadcrumb": {
        "Titles in breadcrumbs are double-escaped": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2018-06-21/2979389-7-easy-breadcrumb--double-escaped-titles.patch"
    },
    "drupal/file_entity": {
        "Temporarily disable the files menu tab": "./patches/file_entity_disable_file_menu_tab.patch"
    }
}
```

Revert the file in git and then try to apply the patch.

Here is the patch command way to un-apply or revert a patch (-R means
revert)

```
patch -p1 -R < ./patches/fix_scary_module.patch
```
To apply the patch:

```
patch -p1 < ./patches/fix_scary_module.patch
```

## Patch modules using patches on Drupal.org

Patches can be applied by referencing them in the composer.json file, in the following format. [cweagans/composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) can then be used to apply the patches on any subsequent website builds.

In order to install and manage patches using composer we need to require the "composer-patches" module: 

```
composer require cweagans/composer-patches
```


Examples of patches to core look like:

```json
  "extra": {
    "patches": {
      "drupal/core": {
        "Add startup configuration for PHP server": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/add_a_startup-1543858-30.patch"
      }
    }
  },
```


```json
  "extra": {
    "patches": {
      "drupal/core": {
        "Ignore front end vendor folders to improve directory search performance": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/ignore_front_end_vendor-2329453-116.patch"",
        "My custom local patch": "./patches/drupal/some_patch-1234-1.patch"
      }
    }
  },
```

Some developers like adding the actual link to the issue in the description like this:

```json
"extra": {
  "patches": {
      "drupal/core": {
          "Views Exposed Filter Block not inheriting the display handlers cache tags, causing filter options not to appear, https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3067937": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2019-07-15/drupal-exposed_filter_block_cache_tags-3067937-4.patch",
          "Cannot use relationship for rendered entity on Views https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2457999": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2021-05-13/9.1.x-2457999-267-views-relationship-rendered-entity.patch"
      },
```


See [Drupal 9 and Composer Patches](https://vazcell.com/blog/how-apply-patch-drupal-9-composer)
also [Managing patches with Composer](https://acquia.my.site.com/s/article/360048081193-Managing-patches-with-Composer)



### Step by step 

1. Find the issue and patch in the issue queue on Drupal.org
2. Use the title and ID of the issue to be able to locate this post in the future. E.g. [Using an issue for the Gin admin theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/gin/issues/3188521) "Improve content form detection - 3188521" 
3. Scroll down the issue to find the specific patch you want to apply e.g. for comment #8 grab the file link for `3188521-8.patch`.  It is [https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2021-05-19/3188521-8.patch](https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2021-05-19/3188521-8.patch)
4. Add the module name, description and URL for the patch into the extra patches section of json:

```json
  "extra": {
    "patches": {
      "drupal/core": {
        "Add startup configuration for PHP server": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/add_a_startup-1543858-30.patch"
      },
      "drupal/gin": {
        "Improve content form detection - 3188521": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2021-05-19/3188521-8.patch"
      }
    }
  }

```
5. use `composer update --lock` to apply the patch and watch the output.


If the patch was not applied or throws an error which is quite common (because they are no longer compatible), try using `-vvv` (verbose mode) flag with composer to see the reason: 

```
composer update -vvv
```

## Patches from a Gitlab merge request

Using the URL of the merge request, add .patch at the end of the URL and that will be the path to the latest patch.

e.g. for a merge request at [https://git.drupalcode.org/project/alt_stream_wrappers/-/merge_requests/2](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/alt_stream_wrappers/-/merge_requests/2) or [https://git.drupalcode.org/project/alt_stream_wrappers/-/merge_requests/2/diffs?view=parallel](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/alt_stream_wrappers/-/merge_requests/2/diffs?view=parallel)

The patch is at [https://git.drupalcode.org/project/alt_stream_wrappers/-/merge_requests/2.patch](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/alt_stream_wrappers/-/merge_requests/2.patch)



## composer.json patches in separate file

To separate patches into a different file other than composer json add
`"patches-file"` section under `"extra"`. See example below:

```json
"extra": {
    "installer-paths": {
        "web/core": ["type:drupal-core"],
        "web/libraries/{$name}": ["type:drupal-library"],
        "web/modules/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-module"],
        "web/profiles/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-profile"],
        "web/themes/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-theme"],
        "drush/Commands/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-drush"],
        "web/modules/custom/{$name}": ["type:drupal-custom-module"],
        "web/themes/custom/{$name}": ["type:drupal-custom-theme"]
    },
    "drupal-scaffold": {
        "locations": {
            "web-root": "web/"
        },
        "excludes": [
            "robots.txt",
            ".htaccess"
        ]
    },
    "patches-file": "patches/composer.patches.json"
}
```

If composer install fails, try `composer -vvv` for verbose output

If the issue is that it can't find the file for example if it displays the following:

```sh
  - Applying patches for drupal/addtocalendar
    ./patches/add_to_calendar_smart_date_handling.patch (Add support for smart_date fields)
patch '-p1' --no-backup-if-mismatch -d 'web/modules/contrib/addtocalendar' < '/Users/selwyn/Sites/txglobal/patches/add_to_calendar_smart_date_handling.patch'
Executing command (CWD): patch '-p1' --no-backup-if-mismatch -d 'web/modules/contrib/addtocalendar' < '/Users/selwyn/Sites/txglobal/patches/add_to_calendar_smart_date_handling.patch'
can't find file to patch at input line 5
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?
```

This means the patch is trying to run the patch in the directory `web/modules/contrib/addtocalendar` (notice the `-d web/modules/contrib/addtocalendar` above

In this case, recreate the patch with the `--no-prefix` option i.e.

```sh
git diff --no-prefix >./patches/patch2.patch
```

Then composer install will apply the patch correctly

## Stop files being overwritten during composer operations

Depending on your composer.json, files like development.services.yml may be overwritten from during scaffolding. To prevent certain scaffold files from being overwritten every time you run a Composer command you can specify them in the "extra" section of your project's composer.json. See the docs on Excluding scaffold files.

The following snippet prevents the development.services.yml from being regularly overwritten:
```
"drupal-scaffold": {
    "locations": {
        "web-root": "web/"
    },
    "file-mapping": {
        "[web-root]/sites/development.services.yml": false
    }
},
```
The code above is from <https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/development-tools/disable-caching#s-beware-of-scaffolding>

and from <https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-drupals-composer-scaffold#toc_6>: Sometimes, a project might prefer to entirely replace a scaffold file provided by a dependency, and receive no further updates for it. This can be done by setting the value for the scaffold file to exclude to false.  In the example below, three files are excluded from being overwritten:

```
  "name": "my/project",
  ...
  "extra": {
    "drupal-scaffold": {
      "locations": {
        "web-root": "web/"
      },
      "file-mapping": {
        "[web-root]/robots.txt": false
        "[web-root]/.htaccess": false,
        "[web-root]/sites/development.services.yml": false
      },
      ...
    }
  }
```

## Add a module that isn't currently supported in your version of drupal

Use these steps when upgrading from Drupal 9 to Drupal 10:

Install the composer lenient plugin
`composer require mglaman/composer-drupal-lenient`



This makes `composer.json` look like this:


```
Notice the `require` key and the `config` key below
```json
    "require": {
        "acquia/memcache-settings": "^1.2",
        ...
        "mglaman/composer-drupal-lenient": "^1.0"
    },
    "conflict": {
        "drupal/drupal": "*"
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "prefer-stable": true,
    "config": {
        "allow-plugins": {
            "composer/installers": true,
            "drupal/core-composer-scaffold": true,
            "drupal/core-project-message": true,
            "phpstan/extension-installer": true,
            "dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer": true,
            "php-http/discovery": true,
            "cweagans/composer-patches": true,
            "mglaman/composer-drupal-lenient": true
        },
```

Specify which Drupal module that composer should be lenient with: 

```
composer config --merge --json extra.drupal-lenient.allowed-list '["drupal/node_access_rebuild_progressive"]'
```
And `composer.json` gets this added:

```json
        "drupal-lenient": {
            "allowed-list": ["drupal/node_access_rebuild_progressive"]
        }
```

If you haven't already installed the [cweagans composer patches plugin](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) use: 

```
composer require cweagans/composer-patches
```


Create the patch file `patches/node_access_rebuild_progressive_d10.patch` with the following contents.  It is on [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/node_access_rebuild_progressive/issues/3288770#comment-15227586).

        },

```


Install the module with:

`composer require drupal/node_access_rebuild_progressive`

The module will be installed and the patch applied!

## Test composer (dry run)

If you want to run through an installation without actually installing a package, you can use --dry-run. This will simulate the installation and show you what would happen.

```sh
composer update --dry-run "drupal/*"
```
produces something like:

```sh
Package operations: 0 installs, 4 updates, 0 removals
  - Updating drupal/core (8.8.2) to drupal/core (8.8.4)
  - Updating drupal/config_direct_save (1.0.0) to drupal/config_direct_save (1.1.0)
  - Updating drupal/core-recommended (8.8.2) to drupal/core-recommended (8.8.4)
  - Updating drupal/crop (1.5.0) to drupal/crop (2.0.0)
```

1\. The caret constraint (`^`): this will allow any new versions
except BREAKING ones---in other words, the first number in the version
cannot increase, but the others can. `drupal/foo:^1.0` would allow
anything greater than or equal to 1.0 but less than 2.0.x. If you need
to specify a version, this is the recommended method.

2\. The tilde constraint (\~): this is a bit more restrictive than the
caret constraint. It means composer can download a higher version of the
last digit specified only. For example, drupal/foo:\~1.2 will allow
anything greater than or equal to version 1.2 (i.e., 1.2.0, 1.3.0,
1.4.0,...,1.999.999), but it won't allow that first 1 to increment to a
2.x release. Likewise, drupal/foo:\~1.2.3 will allow anything from 1.2.3
to 1.2.999, but not 1.3.0.

3\. The other constraints are a little more self-explanatory. You can
specify a version range with operators, a specific stability level
(e.g., -stable or -dev ), or even specify wildcards with \*.

Version range: By using comparison operators you can specify ranges of
valid versions. Valid operators are \>, \>=, \<, \<=, !=.

You can define multiple ranges. Ranges separated by a space ( ) or comma
(,) will be treated as a logical AND. A double pipe (\|\|) will be
treated as a logical OR. AND has higher precedence than OR.

Note: Be careful when using unbounded ranges as you might end up
unexpectedly installing versions that break backwards compatibility.
Consider using the caret operator instead for safety.


Examples:

- \>=1.0

- \>=1.0 \<2.0

- \>=1.0 \<1.1 \|\| \>=1.2

More at <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md>

## Allowing multiple versions

You can use double pipe (`||`) to specify multiple version. 

For the [CSV serialization](https://www.drupal.org/project/csv_serialization) module the author recommends using the following to install the module:
```
composer require drupal/csv_serialization:^2.0 || ^3.0
```

They say: \"It is not possible to support both Drupal 9.x and 10.x in a single release of this module due to a breaking change in EncoderInterface::encode() between Symfony 4.4 (D9) and Symfony 6.2 (D10). When preparing for an upgrade to Drupal 10 we recommend that you widen your Composer version constraints to allow either 2.x or 3.x: `composer require drupal/csv_serialization:^2.0 || ^3.0.` This will allow the module to be automatically upgraded when you upgrade Drupal core.\"
